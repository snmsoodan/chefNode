# oneget

Use the `oneget` InSpec audit resource to test if the named package and/or package version is installed on the system. This resource uses Oneget, which is `part of the Windows Management Framework 5.0 and Windows 10 <https://github.com/OneGet/oneget>`__. This resource uses the `Get-Package` cmdlet to return all of the package names in the Oneget repository.

<br>

## Syntax

A `oneget` resource block declares a package and (optionally) a package version:

    describe oneget('name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `('name')` must specify the name of a package, such as `'VLC'`
* `be_installed` is a valid matcher for this resource

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test if VLC is installed

    describe oneget('VLC') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end
