# windows_hotfix

Use the `windows_hotfix` InSpec audit resource to test if the hotfix has been installed on a Windows system.

<br>

## Syntax

A `windows_hotfix` resource block declares a hotfix to validate:

    describe windows_hotfix('name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `('name')` must specify the name of a hotfix, such as `'KB4012213'`
* `be_installed` is a valid matcher for this resource

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test if KB4012213 is installed

    describe windows_hotfix('KB4012213') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

### Test that a hotfix is not installed

    describe windows_hotfix('KB9999999') do
      it { should_not be_installed }
    end
