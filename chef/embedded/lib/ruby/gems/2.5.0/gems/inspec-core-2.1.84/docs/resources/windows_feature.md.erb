# windows_feature

Use the `windows_feature` InSpec audit resource to test features on Windows via the `Get-WindowsFeature` cmdlet.

<br>

## Syntax

A `windows_feature` resource block declares the name of the Windows feature, tests if that feature is installed, and then returns information about that feature:

    describe windows_feature('feature_name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `('feature_name')` must specify a Windows feature name, such as `DHCP Server` or `IIS-Webserver`
* `be_installed` is a valid matcher for this resource

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test the DHCP Server feature

    describe windows_feature('DHCP Server') do
      it{ should be_installed }
    end
