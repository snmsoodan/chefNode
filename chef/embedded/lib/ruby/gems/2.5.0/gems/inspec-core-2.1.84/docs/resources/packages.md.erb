# packages

Use the `packages` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of multiple packages on the system.

<br>

## Syntax

A `packages` resource block declares a regular expression search to select packages

    describe packages(/name/) do
      its('statuses') { should cmp 'installed' }
    end

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Verify that no `xserver` packages are installed

    describe package(/xserver/) do
      its('statuses') { should_not cmp 'installed' }
    end

### Verify all `openssl` packages match a certain version

    describe package(/openssl/) do
      its('versions') { should cmp '1.0.1e-42.el7' }
    end

### Verify that both the `i686` and `x86_64` versions of `libgcc` are installed

    describe package(/libgcc/) do
      its('architectures') { should include 'x86_64' }
      its('architectures') { should include 'i686' }
    end

### versions

The `versions` matcher tests the versions of the packages installed on the system

    its('versions') { should cmp '3.4.0.2-4.el7' }

### architectures

    its('architectures') { should include 'i686' }
