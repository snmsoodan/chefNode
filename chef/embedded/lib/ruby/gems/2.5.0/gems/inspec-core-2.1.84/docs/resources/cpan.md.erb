# cpan

Use the `cpan` InSpec audit resource to test Perl modules that are installed by system packages or the CPAN installer.

<br>

## Syntax

A `cpan` resource block declares a package and (optionally) a package version:

    describe cpan('package_name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `'package_name'` is the name of the package, such as `'DBD::Pg'`
* `be_installed` tests to see if the package described above is installed

<br>

## Resource Parameters

This resource uses package names and perl library paths as resource parameters.

## Resource Parameter Examples

### Test if DBD::Pg is installed on the system

    describe cpan('DBD:Pg') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

### Test if DBD::Pg 3.7.0 is installed on the system

    describe cpan('DBD::Pg') do
      it { should be_installed }
      its('version') { should eq '3.7.0' }
    end

### Test if DBD::Pg is installed within a custom PERL5LIB path on the system

Hint: You can pass multiple paths separated with a colon
`/path/to/perl5/lib:/usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/lib/perl5`

    describe cpan('DBD::Pg', '/home/jdoe/perl5/lib/perl5') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end
